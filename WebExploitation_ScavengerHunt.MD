# Scavenger Hunt

## Set up

This is a 4 part web exploitation CTF which is more tricky than the [[Insp3ct0r]]
Link to the page http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/ You really need to start using Google here or you have to be highly knowleagable on Web tech stuff already. I relied on Google here and the writeup is not giving away everything after the easy finds. Try to look into the hints first and if not successful get into the Spoilers

#### Phase one
Inspected the HTML and found the first part of the flag
#### Phase two
Inspected the mycss file to find the second part of the flag
#### Phase three 
Things start to get more tricky and teh css file guides you to teh javascript file
In there you get a hint : How can I keep Google from indexing my website? 
If you are not sure you should google around My hint is to look into something about robots and text
#### Phase four
You must have found your way into the correct file and in there part of the flag and another hint for the next place to look into. My hint is to look into Apacher server access file and change the url accordingly
#### Phase five
If you found your way to the access file then your next part of the flag and hint is up and running. The main takeaway from the hint is the capitalised Store.. google for Mac and Store file and change the url accordingly
#### Phase six
If you got to the correct file url you should have the entire flag Congrats!
